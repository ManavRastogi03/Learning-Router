# 1. Introduction
React Router is a declarative routing library for React.js that enables navigation and URL handling in a React application. It provides a way to define and organize routes, manage navigation states, and efficiently update the UI based on the current URL.

# 2. Installation
Ensure React Router is installed in your project using the following command:

```javascript
npm install react-router-dom
 ```
# 3. Router Configuration
In your application, configure the router using the createBrowserRouter function. Define routes using the createRoutesFromElements function, providing JSX elements for each route.

```javascript
import { createBrowserRouter, createRoutesFromElements } from 'react-router-dom';

const router = createBrowserRouter(
  createRoutesFromElements(
    <Route path='/' element={<Layout/>}>
      <Route path="" element={<Home/>}/>
      <Route path='about' element={<About/>}/>
      <Route path='contact' element={<Contact/>}/>
      <Route path='user/:userid' element={<User/>}/>
      <Route 
        loader={githubInfoLoader}
        path='Github' element={<Github/>}/>
    </Route>
  )
);
```
4. Routes
Routes are defined using the <Route> component. Each route represents a specific URL path and maps to a corresponding React component. Nested routes can be utilized to structure the application.

5. RouterProvider
The <RouterProvider> component is used to wrap your application and provide access to the router context. It accepts the configured router as a prop.

```javascript

import { RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';

<RouterProvider router={router}>
  {/* Your application components */}
</RouterProvider>
```
6. Navigation Components
React Router provides various navigation components like <Link> and <NavLink> to create links between different routes. These components automatically handle URL updates and navigation.

```javascript

import { Link, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

<Link to='/about'>About</Link>
<NavLink to='/contact' activeClassName='active'>Contact</NavLink>
```
7. Loader Data
For dynamic data loading, the useLoaderData hook can be employed. This hook is used within route components to fetch and utilize data specific to each route.

```javascript
import { useLoaderData } from 'react-router-dom';

function Github() {
  const githubInfo = useLoaderData();
  // Render component with loaded data
}
```
